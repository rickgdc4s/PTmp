  <h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h3>
  <p class="paraindent">My name is Rick Harraghy, I am a software engineer at General Dynamics in Taunton, MA. Currently, I am<br> 
  the Technical Lead of a COTS Integration Team on an Army Tactical Communication project. My past<br>
  experience includes developing software for Air Defense Systems, Ship-based Missile Systems, Modems,<br>
  Network Management and Network Communications Systems, and Software-defined radios.</p>
  <h3>Why are you taking this course ?</h3>
  <p class="paraindent">I have been working in technical roles my entire career, but for the past several years, I have not been<br> 
  engaged in any hands-on software development, and I am feeling a bit rusty. In recent years I have also<br>
  become interested in web-based technologies, and although I have delved into this area several times, I do<br>
  not have very much experience developing web-based applications and would like to become more proficient.</p>
  <h3>What previous experience do you have with programming ?</h3>
  <p class="paraindent">I have software development experience primarily in C, C++, and Motorola Assembly, mostly on Unix/Linux systems,<br> 
  but also on Windows. I have had some limited experience with JAVA, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
  <h3>Are you working on a MAC, PC, or some other platform ?</h3>
  <p class="paraindent">For this course, I will be working on a Windows 7 platform.</p>
  <h3>Anything else we should know ?</h3>
  <p class="paraindent">I do not have much experience with HTML and CSS, and the limited experience that I have<br>
  had is largely from earlier versions of HTML and CSS. I am finding that several of the features that<br>
  I had employed in earlier versions are now deprecated. Besides learning PHP, Laravel, Javascript, etc.<br>
  in this course, I will be re-learning and extending my knowledge of HTML and CSS as well.</p>
